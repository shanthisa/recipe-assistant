Ingredients


1 lb. pkg / 454 g                penne noodles
3 litres                                water, lightly salted
4 each                        garlic cloves. Put through a garlic press or finely chopped
1/3 cup / 80 ml                vegetable oil
2 Tbsp. / 30 ml                Italian seasoning
2 Tsp / 10 ml                        dried parsley flakes
1 Tsp. / 5 ml                        crushed red peppers
¼ cup / 60 ml                Cheddar cheese, grated
¼ cup / 60 ml                Parmesan, grated
                                Salt and pepper to taste




Method




1. Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the penne, stir and cook following package directions to “al dente” stage (pasta still has a bite). Drain and set aside.
2. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a frying pan or skillet over medium low heat. When hot, add the garlic and fry gently until the flavour is released. Be careful not to brown the garlic.
3. Add the Italian seasoning, parsley and crushed red peppers and mix to combine. Place the pasta in the saucepan on low heat and pour the garlic and spice mixture over the pasta. Toss gently to coat pasta and heat through.
4. Place hot pasta in a serving bowl, mix the two cheeses together and sprinkle over the pasta.






Notes:
* 1 lb. of dry pasta will yield approximately 2 ¼ to 2 ½ lbs. of cooked pasta
